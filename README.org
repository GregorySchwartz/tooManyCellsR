This package is an R wrapper around =too-many-cells=. See
[[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells]] for latest version of the
program this wrapper targets.

See [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519660v1][the bioRxiv paper]] for more information about the algorithm.

* Description

=too-many-cells= is a suite of tools, algorithms, and visualizations focusing on
the relationships between cell clades. This includes new ways of clustering,
plotting, choosing differential expression comparisons, and more!
=TooManyCellsR= is an R wrapper around =too-many-cells= to facilitate
ease-of-use for R users. *This package requires =too-many-cells= to be installed
and in your path!* See [[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells]] for
detailed installation instructions.

* Installation

First install =too-many-cells= using the instructions in the [[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells][documentation]].
Next, install this packages from github:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("GregorySchwartz/tooManyCellsR")
#+END_SRC shell

* Usage

This package allows for all features from =too-many-cells= to be used in R, with
a focus on the =make-tree= entry point. For more information about the different
options, see the documentation for =make-tree= with included examples at
[[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells]].

The input matrix should be of Matrix format from the Matrix library, with cell
barcode column names and features (genes) as row names. The =labels= argument
takes a data frame with =item= (cell barcodes) and =label= (whatever labels you
want to give them, such as tissue of origin, celltype, etc.) columns.

The =args= argument contains a list of command line arguments fed to
=too-many-cells=. The default is to just have =make-tree= as an argument. For a
detailed list, check =too-many-cells make-tree -h= and check out the
documentation at [[https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells]].

The main function to use is =tooManyCells=. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
tooManyCells(mat, args = c("make-tree", "--smart-cutoff", "4", "--min-size", "1"))
plot(res$treePlot, axes = FALSE)
res$stdout
res$nodeInfo
plot(res$clumpinessPlot, axes = FALSE)
#+END_SRC r
